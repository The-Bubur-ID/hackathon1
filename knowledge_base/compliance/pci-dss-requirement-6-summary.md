*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.4*

### 6.4.1 Web Application Security
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.4.1*

- Or by installing a web application firewall (WAF)

### 6.4.2 Automated Technical Solutions
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.4.2*
- For public-facing web applications, implement automated technical solutions
- Solutions must detect and prevent web-based attacks
- Examples: WAF, runtime application self-protection (RASP)

## 6.5 Common Vulnerabilities in Bespoke and Custom Software
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5*

Applications must be protected against the following vulnerabilities:

### 6.5.1 Injection Flaws
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5.1*
**Primary Focus: SQL Injection**
- Use parameterized queries, stored procedures, or prepared statements
- Validate all input on the server side
- Escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for the target interpreter
- Use whitelist input validation where appropriate

**Example Prevention:**
```sql
-- Vulnerable
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + userId + ';

-- Secure  
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;
```

### 6.5.2 Buffer Overflows
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5.2*
- Validate input length before processing
- Use programming languages or frameworks that automatically protect against buffer overflows
- Implement bounds checking

### 6.5.3 Insecure Cryptographic Storage
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5.3*
- Use strong cryptography and security protocols
- Protect cryptographic keys appropriately
- Use proper key management practices

### 6.5.4 Insecure Communications
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5.4*
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit using strong cryptography
- Never send unencrypted PANs by end-user messaging technologies
- Use only trusted keys and certificates

### 6.5.5 Improper Error Handling
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5.5*
- Do not return system error messages or debug information to users
- Log security events for monitoring and analysis
- Use generic error messages for user-facing applications

### 6.5.6 High, Critical, or "Critical Impact" Vulnerabilities
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5.6*
- Address all vulnerabilities rated as "high" or "critical" by industry standards
- This includes vulnerabilities identified by vulnerability scanning tools
- Prioritize based on industry vulnerability scoring systems (CVSS)

### 6.5.7 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*Reference: PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 6.5.7*
- Validate all input on the server side
- Encode output to prevent script execution
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Sanitize user input using appropriate libraries

**Example Prevention:**
```javascript
// Vulnerable
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// Secure
element.textContent = userInput;
// OR
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### 6.5.8 Improper Access Control
